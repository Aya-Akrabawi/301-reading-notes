description: "Whether your search is limited to a single database or is as expansive as all of cyberspace, you won't find the intended results unless you use the words that work. Now in its second edition, Sara Knapp has updated and expanded this invaluable resource. Unlike any other thesaurus available, this popular guide offers a wealth of natural language options in a convenient, A-to-Z format. It's ideal for helping users find the appropriate word or words for computer searches in the humanities, social sciences, and business. The second edition has added more than 9,000 entries to the first edition's extensive list. Now, the Thesaurus contains almost 21,000 search entries! New or expanded areas include broader coverage of business terms and humanities-including arts literature, philosophy, religion, and music.",

"Travis Hill"

publisher: "Travis Hill",
description: "College sophomore Tyler Gallagher loves computers, video games, and Thanksgiving Break. He's timed the arrival of his computer components with the holiday vacation from school to blast aliens and enemy soldiers alike on his brand new, high-end gaming computer. When the parts arrive, it soon becomes apparent that they aren't what he ordered from TechTerritory. Thinking he's the butt of a practical joke, Tyler plays along, and builds the computer with the obviously fake components. His annoyance turns to shock when the computer powers on. His shock turns to a mix of disbelief and wonder when he learns the strange "quantum" computer can pull web pages from the near future. Disbelief and wonder soon become fear and uncertainty when he discovers the future might not be so bright. "Search Terms: Alpha" is the first half of a new time travel thriller. 52,000 word novel Adult themes / language / mild sexual content",

description: "The annual colloquium on information retrieval research provides an opportunity for both new and established researchers to present papers describing work in progress or ?nal results. This colloquium was established by the BCS IRSG(B- tish Computer Society Information Retrieval Specialist Group), and named the Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research. Recently, the location of the colloquium has alternated between the United Kingdom and continental Europe. To re?ect the growing European orientation of the event, the colloquium was renamed “European Annual Colloquium on Information Retrieval Research” from 2001. Since the inception of the colloquium in 1979 the event has been hosted in the city of Glasgow on four separate occasions. However, this was the ?rst time that the organization of the colloquium had been jointly undertaken by three separate computer and information science departments; an indication of the collaborative nature and diversity of IR research within the universities of the West of Scotland. The organizers of ECIR 2002 saw a sharp increase in the number of go- quality submissions in answer to the call for papers over previous years and as such 52 submitted papers were each allocated 3 members of the program committee for double blind review of the manuscripts. A total of 23 papers were eventually selected for oral presentation at the colloquium in Glasgow which gave an acceptance rate of less than 45% and ensured a very high standard of the papers presented.",

title: "Comparative Evaluation of the Retrieval Effectiveness of Descriptor and Free-text Search Systems Using CIRCOL (Central Information Reference and Control-on-Line)",
authors: [
"Donald W. King"
],
publishedDate: "1972",
description: "The study compares the retrieval effectiveness of two alternative input and search systems in terms of such measures as recall, fallout, precision, and total retrieval. One system operates using manually indexed document files searched by controlled vocabulary while the other employs full- text input using natural language searching. Both systems are applied to a common data base and hardware. Operational information needs were used in the form of request statements from actual users. From these statements of need, search queries were formulated for both systems and recall estimates calculated using a recall base that was pre-specified by the request origninator. The queries were processed and total retrieval, fallout and precision ratios were calculated for both systems. The results indicate that the two systems perform at approximately the same level of effectiveness, although estimated average total retrieval was found to be slightly greater for free-text searching than for descriptor searching at all levels of recall.",
