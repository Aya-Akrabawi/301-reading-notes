Read: 14b - What Google Learned About Teams

- It is important to work with the team to build new and different knowledge but try to choose them carefully as we read from rovosky story, we understand that sometimes groups put stress on you.

- As a worker, you might start your morning by collaborating with a team of engineers, then send emails to colleagues marketing a new brand, then jump on a conference call planning an entirely different product line, while also juggling team meetings with accounting and the party-planning committee. To prepare students for that complex world, business schools around the country have revised their curriculums to emphasize team-focused learning.

- Studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction.

**SuperAgent**
SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!

```
 request
   .post('/api/pet')
   .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })
   .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')
   .set('Accept', 'application/json')
   .then(res => {
      alert('yay got ' + JSON.stringify(res.body));
   });

   ```

   ## REST:
  **what is REST?** REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. 
  
  **MAKING REQUESTS**
REST requires that a client make a request to the server in order to retrieve or modify data on the server. A request generally consists of:

- an HTTP verb, which defines what kind of operation to perform
- a header, which allows the client to pass along information about the request
- a path to a resource
- an optional message body containing data
